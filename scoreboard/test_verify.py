test_verify.py — regression suite for the scoreboard merge gate (scoreboard/verify.py).

Mirrors bench/quantum-judge/test_judge.py's expect-pass / expect-fail discipline:
the committed seed entries must ACCEPT, and every class of scoreboard fraud must be
FAILed per-entry (never a crash). If this suite is green, the merge gate is sound:
an entry cannot point at someone else's ACCEPTing bundle, claim a metric the judge
did not recompute, or lie about its tie-break resource costs.

Run:  python3 scoreboard/test_verify.py   (exit 0 = all pass; offline, stdlib only)
